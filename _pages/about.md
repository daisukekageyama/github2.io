Thank you for coming to my page!

I am Daisuke Kageyama, a candidate for Master of Public Policy (MPP) at Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago. My goal is to apply data science to public policy-making for sustainable development.

Before joining the Harris School of Public Policy, I served as an assistant director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan where I evaluated the feasibility and the social impact of the international cooperation projects in African and East European countries. Also, I developed a 4.6 billion financial aid scheme during the pandemic to support developing countries' economic recovery from a liquidity crisis. 

Previously, I served as a chief at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism of Japan, where I took a vital role in the 21 system reforms regarding financial aid for municipalities to take adaptive measures for the climate crisis. Also, I led a project team of seven experts to create new strategies for the National Resilience Plan of Japan, which was approved by the Cabinet of Japan in 2018. Also, I conducted rapid financial support for damaged municipalities to respond to Japan floods in 2018 and Typhoon Hagibis in 2019 and contributed to the immediate reconstruction of these regions.

I earned my bachelor's degree in Forest Science from Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan, specializing in erosion control engineering
